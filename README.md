# Outfit-selector-program
Personal project that selects an outfit for the user.

*NOTE* This is an ongoing project and is being tweaked and developed.

The goal for this project was to use a decision tree style method in conjuction with a weather API to suggest an outfit based upon factors such as temperature, weather, formality and so on. The clothing items are stored in a nested dectionary, allowing for each clothing item to have attributes attached to them to further the decision making process. The program also has standalone weather forecasting functions.
